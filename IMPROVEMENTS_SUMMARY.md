# GPT4Free Improvements Summary

## Overview
This pull request implements several critical improvements to error handling, resource management, and debugging capabilities in the gpt4free library.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced TimeoutError Class (`g4f/errors.py`)
**Problem**: The original `TimeoutError` class lacked contextual information for debugging.

**Solution**: Enhanced the class with additional attributes:
- `timeout`: The timeout value that was exceeded
- `provider`: The provider that caused the timeout
- `message`: Detailed error message

**Benefits**:
- Better debugging experience for developers
- More informative error messages for users
- Easier identification of problematic providers

### 2. Improved Browser Resource Management (`g4f/requests/__init__.py`)
**Problem**: Browser cleanup in the `get_nodriver` function didn't properly handle exceptions, potentially leading to resource leaks.

**Solution**: 
- Enhanced the `on_stop` function with better exception handling
- Added detailed logging for cleanup errors
- Improved timeout error handling with enhanced `TimeoutError`
- Added browser session context manager for automatic cleanup

**Benefits**:
- Prevents browser resource leaks
- More robust error handling during cleanup
- Better logging for debugging browser issues
- Automatic resource cleanup with context manager

### 3. Enhanced Tool Argument Validation (`g4f/tools/run_tools.py`)
**Problem**: JSON parsing errors in tool arguments were not properly handled, potentially causing crashes.

**Solution**: 
- Added comprehensive try-catch for JSON parsing
- Detailed error messages for malformed JSON
- Better error context for debugging

**Benefits**:
- Prevents crashes from malformed tool arguments
- Clear error messages for developers
- More robust tool processing

### 4. Improved Debug Error Formatting (`g4f/debug.py`)
**Problem**: Error messages in debug logs were inconsistent and sometimes unclear.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced error formatting to distinguish between strings and exceptions
- Better handling of different error types
- More consistent error message formatting

**Benefits**:
- Clearer debug output
- Better error categorization
- Improved developer experience

### 5. Enhanced Retry Provider Error Logging (`g4f/providers/retry_provider.py`)
**Problem**: Error logs didn't include exception type information, making debugging difficult.

**Solution**:
- Added exception type names to error logs
- More detailed error context

**Benefits**:
- Easier debugging of provider failures
- Better error tracking and analysis

## Code Quality Improvements

### Error Handling
- Consistent exception handling patterns
- Better error context and messaging
- Proper resource cleanup in error scenarios

### Resource Management  
- Automatic browser session cleanup
- Memory leak prevention
- Better resource lifecycle management

### Debugging Support
- Enhanced error messages with context
- Better logging for troubleshooting
- Improved developer experience

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
1. `g4f/errors.py` - Enhanced TimeoutError class
2. `g4f/requests/__init__.py` - Improved browser resource management
3. `g4f/tools/run_tools.py` - Enhanced tool argument validation
4. `g4f/debug.py` - Improved error formatting
5. `g4f/providers/retry_provider.py` - Better error logging

### Backward Compatibility
All changes are backward compatible. Existing code will continue to work without modifications.

### Testing
The improvements have been tested with a comprehensive test suite that validates:
- Enhanced TimeoutError functionality
- Tool argument validation with various inputs
- Debug error formatting
- Browser context manager functionality

## Impact

### For Users
- More informative error messages
- Better stability and performance
- Reduced resource usage

### For Developers  
- Easier debugging and troubleshooting
- Better error context for development
- More robust error handling patterns

### For Maintainers
- Cleaner resource management
- Better logging for issue tracking
- More maintainable codebase

## Next Steps

These improvements provide a solid foundation for:
1. Further error handling enhancements
2. Additional resource management optimizations
3. More comprehensive debugging tools
4. Performance monitoring improvements

The changes follow Python best practices and maintain the library's existing API while providing significant improvements to stability and usability.
